cpdlldeps.sh: recursively find the DLL dependencies of the object specified and
copy them to the working directory.

Make sure the directories holding the DLLs are in your PATH, e.g. by:
	PATH=$PATH:/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32
Then copy the DLL dependencies of prog.exe to the working directory with:
	./cpdlldeps prog.exe
